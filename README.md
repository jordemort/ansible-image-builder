- Re: splash screen/seamless transition
  - Discovered that syslinux doesn't have an equivalent to GRUB2's [gfxpayload](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/gfxpayload.html) - bootloader will need to be GRUB2 for seamless transition from bootloader to splash screen to desktop.
  - Need to investigate differences between Plymouth in Ubuntu and Plymouth in Debian and possibly build the Ubuntu version of it.

- Original plan was to use xorg + steamos-compositor and then put off doing a custom Wayland compositor until a version 2, but it looks like Qt5 makes whipping up a custom Wayland compositor [dead-ass easy](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwaylandcompositor-index.html) so I think we're going Wayland from the start.
